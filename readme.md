# Kaggle :WiDS Global Datathon 2026
### Predicting Time-to-Threat for Evacuation Zones Using Survival Analysis

Link : <https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/WiDSWorldWide_GlobalDathon26/overview>


## Overview
When a wildfire ignites, emergency managers face an impossible question with incomplete information. Which fires will reach populated areas? How quickly? And which communities should prepare first?

This year's WiDS Global Datathon challenges participants to build survival models that answer these questions using only the earliest signals available. Your task is to predict the probability that a wildfire will threaten an evacuation zone within 12, 24, 48, and 72 hours, drawing on data from just the first five hours after ignition.

The goal is not a single prediction but a calibrated forecast across multiple time horizons. Emergency responders need both urgency rankings (which fires demand immediate attention) and probability estimates they can trust when making high-stakes decisions about evacuations, resource deployment, and public alerts.

----------------------------------------------------------------

## Description

#### Problem
When a wildfire ignites, emergency managers and responders must decide which communities to warn, when to warn them, and where to position scarce resources. Decisions must be made before certainty is available. The response requires both prioritization (which fires are most urgent soon) and calibrated risk estimates (how likely a fire is to threaten evacuation zones within actionable time windows).

This competition turns that operational need into a survival analysis challenge. You will generate calibrated probability forecasts across multiple time horizons to support real-world decisions.

#### Real-World Context
Many wildfire forecasting approaches reduce the task to a single question. Will this fire become dangerous. Emergency response needs more. Decisions are time-bound and comparative. How soon is a threat likely. How confident should we be. Which incident should move to the front of the queue when crews, aircraft, and messaging capacity are limited.

This competition addresses that gap by framing the task as survival analysis using real early-incident signals. The dataset captures wildfire perimeter dynamics and their spatial relationship to evacuation zones. Features are computed strictly from the first five hours after the initial perimeter observation, t0. The target is the time from t0 plus 5 hours until the fire comes within 5 km of any evacuation zone centroid.

#### Survival Analysis Framing and Censoring
This is right-censored survival analysis:

- If a fire hits within the 72-hour window, event = 1 and time_to_hit_hours is the observed time from t0+5h.
- If a fire does not hit within 72 hours, event = 0 and time_to_hit_hours is the last observed time in the window (<= 72).


Participants do not predict a single time. They submit survival probabilities that a hit occurs by 12h, 24h, 48h, and 72h. The strongest solutions will deliver two outcomes at once. They will rank fires correctly by urgency for triage and produce calibrated probabilities that can support threshold-based decisions.

------------------------------------------------------

## Evaluation
Primary Metric:

**Hybrid Score = 0.3 x C-index + 0.7 x (1 - Weighted Brier Score)**

### C-index (30%)
- Measures how well you rank fires by urgency
- Higher is better (0.5 to 1.0)
### Weighted Brier Score (70%)
- Measures calibration at 24h, 48h, 72h
- Uses censor-aware evaluation:
    - Hits: 1 if hit by horizon H, else 0
    - Censored after H: 0
    - Censored before H: excluded
- Final weighted average: 0.3 x Brier@24h + 0.4 x Brier@48h + 0.3 x Brier@72h
### Why 48h Is Weighted Highest
- 24-48 hours is the strongest operational value zone
- 48h is emphasized because it balances actionable lead time with decision urgency.
- 72h is included for extended planning, but it can be less operationally immediate than earlier horizons.

Watch Duty is revolutionizing emergency alerts by delivering life-saving information when it’s needed most. As disasters become more frequent and severe, outdated alert systems continue to fail communities and first responders when every second counts.

Born from lived experience and powered by first responders, engineers, radio operators, and fire spotters, Watch Duty is a nonprofit that delivers hyperlocal, real-time updates to over 6 million users across 22 states. With a lean team of 20 staff and 200+ volunteer firefighters, dispatchers, and radio operators, we provide ground-level intelligence through map-integrated alerts fueled by scanners, cameras, and social feeds that are tailored to the communities that need them most.

During the 2025 LA wildfires, we became the #1 most downloaded app, surpassing ChatGPT as the top free app, proving massive public demand for trusted alerts. We took twice the load of Wikipedia (100k requests per second) during the LA fires when all other systems crashed. Watch Duty became the signal in the noise and we provide this information for free.
